I have a new idea I want to implmenet eventually, 
that is where the possition of the cube makes a sentence.
So basically each piece as long as there are degrees of freedom left makes bits up to be placed, and then you use those bits with an encoding to create letters.

So I found RubikOptimal which supposedly should allow me to have a solver to get to that location once I know what it is.

I probably should just use a c implementation instead of something that takes almost a gig of space, but I assume if I run out I will find this project and kill the venv.
 The page is here https://pypi.org/project/RubikOptimal/

Well, I read further down and saw that it can take like 3 hours to solve even after the tables have been generated.  I think I will run the c code instead.

Here is a c++ solver, but it has a gui, so I don't know if it counts.

Here is a python solver which is not optimal but it is fast:
https://pypi.org/project/kociemba/

I got it integrated.  Now the solver works with my cube!! And the commands work as well.  Now the next part is to produce the sentence encoder.
I suppose getting the cube into the sentence is first and then decoding the cube second.  Because if I don't have a cube to decode, it makes decoding pointless.

Ok, the decoder that I had is here:

Ok, making the huffy_code.py file but the tree inversion step is having gass and I am running out the door now and can not solve it.

Ok, I got it so that you can convert a number to a cube, but I am trying to add code so that it makes the cube solveable and it is only half there.  Every other number turns out not to have enough degrees of freedom to make it solveable.
Looking at what is messed up, I don't think I messed the code up, I think there is a logical issue.  I think I need to not just have the rotation of one cube and two edges be reserved. I think I need some location movement.  I am pretty sure if you swap a corner edge, the edges also have to move, not just rotate.  Anyways that is what needs to be played with next.
