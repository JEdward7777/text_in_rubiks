I have a new idea I want to implmenet eventually, 
that is where the possition of the cube makes a sentence.
So basically each piece as long as there are degrees of freedom left makes bits up to be placed, and then you use those bits with an encoding to create letters.

So I found RubikOptimal which supposedly should allow me to have a solver to get to that location once I know what it is.

I probably should just use a c implementation instead of something that takes almost a gig of space, but I assume if I run out I will find this project and kill the venv.
 The page is here https://pypi.org/project/RubikOptimal/

Well, I read further down and saw that it can take like 3 hours to solve even after the tables have been generated.  I think I will run the c code instead.

Here is a c++ solver, but it has a gui, so I don't know if it counts.

Here is a python solver which is not optimal but it is fast:
